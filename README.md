This repo shall contain boilerplate react code, wiki, readme, learnings, etc..

Boilerplate app.
Creating state dynamically.
Updating the parent state: bidirectional flow.
Links to good articles.
Module Loaders:
  require.js
  browserify
  webpack
For react - use webpack - more featureful.
Code all modules seperately and have a single entry point.
Just say: `require(./module.js);` -> this wont work in a browser.
So use a node js installed on the system.
npm install webpack.
webpack.config.js file -> 
webpack
NODE_ENV=production webpack
open index.html

npm install -S jquery
npm install -S lodash

Mockeru -> to create random json object.
